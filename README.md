# Azure Incident Response with Datadog

# 1. Intro

In this *quick* section we'll set up a test, assign a metric as a monitor, then go through a quick incident. 

# 2. Synthetic Testing

In order to test the site we created earlier in the lab, we'll set up a synthetic monitor. 

You can do that by following this [link to create a mutli-step syntethic test](https://us3.datadoghq.com/synthetics/multi-step/create).

In a different tab, we'll need to retrieve the URL for our app service from the [Azure App Services page](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.Web%2Fsites).
